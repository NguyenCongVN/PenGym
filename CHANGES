PenGym v0.2
-----------
* Second public release of PenGym supports more complex scenarios.
  The main changes are listed below:
    - Ran pentesting paths with all available scenarios in NASim
    - Created CyRIS cyber range description automatically based on PenGym scenario
    - Implemented opimization mechanisms for action execution time and training time
    - Fixed several issues in NASim to revise the correrct logical simulations
    (References: https://github.com/Jjschwartz/NetworkAttackSimulator/issues
    - Issues 45, 46, 47)

*  Added cyber_range folder where cyber range descriptions and neccessary files are to be instantiated.
   It contains a sample folder of medium-multi-site for reference.

* Re-organized database folder for consistency, including the following folders:
    - configuration_scripts: contains additional scripts for cyber range configuration
    - resources: contains services and process installation scripts
    - scenarios: available scenario files in PenGym, which created based on NASim scenario files

* Added cyber_range_creation folders inside the pengym directory, which contain modules
  that automatically create cyber range descriptions from PenGym scenarios.
  A sample folder of the medium-multi-site scenario are created for reference

* Added a scripts folder inside the pengym/envs directory. This folder contains bash script files
  for updating, reseting firewall and gateway configurations within VMs during the pentesting period.
  It supports the main server (KVM host), which controls and manages the actions executed on other VM hosts.

* Revised run.py file to integrate host_map and bridge_map creation functions,
  restore firewall status of VMs functions, and changed pentesting path to be compatible
  with medium-multi-site scenarios, the largest scenario.

* Revised network.py file with minor bug fixes, measured execution time,
  and overridden traffic permitted functions to fix modeling issues in NASim

* Revised the host_vector.py file with several implementations:
    - Implemented all actions in the action space in NASim
    - Integrated host_map and boolean flag mechanisms to optimize execution time
    - Measured execution time of each action
    - Implemented functions to fix modeling issues in NASim

* Revised the utilities.py file with several additional functions:
    - Implemented functions to intialize host_map and bridge_map automatically
    - Implemented function to restore the firewall state of the entire VM hosts
    - Implemented additional functions which support the action execution in complex scenarios
      such as function to control and manage the bridge and gateway states

* Revised storyboard.py file with more constant values

* Other minor improvements and bug fixes

* Updated the README.md file to provide package installation requirements,
  revise the quick start part which includes cyber range description creation.

* Updated the CONFIG.yml file with more configuration information
  which include cyber range description creation and action execution processes.

PenGym v0.1
-----------
* First public release of PenGym, a pentesting training framework for
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. The main characteristic of the
  framework is that it converts the actions generated by the RL agents
  into real actions that are executed in a cyber range, thus making it
  possible to train the pentesting agents in realistic networks.
